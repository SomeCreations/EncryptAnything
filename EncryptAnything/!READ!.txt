This was a test project to see what I could
accomplish with AES256 encrypting on strings
and text files. The encrypting parts are copied
are pasted.

Knowing how to utilize AES256 encrypting, it has
allowed me to use it on multiple occasions in
different projects, giving the user a peace of
mind knowing their data is secure.
